# Topics
Planning for future post.

## Language Agnostic
- [ ] diffing algorithms.
- [ ] write ahead logging.
- [ ] string metric algorithms
- [ ] point in polygon and polyhedron for uses in things like geofencing.
- [ ] r-tree.
- [ ] bloom filter.

## C
- [ ] build an allocator/memory arena. Differences between them.
- [ ] build a hashmap and different hashing algorithms.
- [ ] lock free queue
- [ ] sqlite clone.
- [ ] error handling - errno vs return int with an out param vs global error queue with an error struct vs result struct (similar to rust's `Result<T, E>`).
- [ ] struct alignment and packing.
- [ ] disallowing functions in a project - `#pragma GCC poison <function_name>` vs `grep -lr <function_name> ./ | wc -l`


## Go
- [ ] sql parser that can query both postgresql and the filesystem (json files).
