I'm a software engineer who has a lot of curiousity, a few wildly unpopular opinions, and a deep loathing for installing a dependency to take care of anything. So enjoy!

Current development environment is a $10 Amazon Basics keyboard, a refurbished HP ProDesk running fedora linux (v43, gnome de), and a 50 line vimrc.

If that's interesting to you, feel free to read more seriously [about me](/about) or look at my [posts](/posts).
