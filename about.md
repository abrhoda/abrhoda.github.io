I am a senior software engineer with Capital One building on MessageHub, a platform focused on inbound and outbound customer messaging. It is a large scale, distributed, and fault tolerant system written in mostly java and python hosted on AWS. 


This site is a place for me to explore concepts in languages I like to use - mainly go and scala. Concepts include architectural patterns, build and automation tools, as well as programming langauge level features. I will also share projects I'm working on in some posts.


I currently live in Indiana with my golden retriever, Jeffrey. I can be reached directly through the email address listed below.
