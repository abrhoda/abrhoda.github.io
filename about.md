I am a principal software engineer with Capital One building on MessageHub, a platform focused on inbound and outbound customer messaging. It is a large scale, distributed, and fault tolerant system written in mostly java and python hosted on AWS. 


This site is a place for me to write about software. Right now, I'm mostly writing c, c++, or the occasional go. Topics range from projects I'm working on, architecture, design patterns, classic algorithms and data structures, and anything in between! 


I currently live in Indiana with my golden retriever, Jeffrey. I can be reached directly through the email address listed below.
