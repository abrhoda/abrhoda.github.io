I am a principal software engineer with Capital One building on MessageHub, a platform focused on inbound and outbound customer messaging. It is a large scale, distributed, and fault tolerant system written in mostly java and python hosted on AWS. 

This site is a place for me to write about software. Right now, I'm mostly writing C in my projects so that will be the current focus but the occassional post might be about/using Go or Java. Topics range from projects I'm working on, architecture, design patterns, classic algorithms and data structures, and anything in between! 

I currently live in Indiana with my golden retriever, Jeffrey. I can be reached directly through the email address listed below.
