I am currently a senior software engineer at Carvana in their Carvana Wholesale Tech division. Previously, I was a principal software engineer with Capital One building on MessageHub, a platform focused on inbound and outbound customer messaging. In the recent years, regardless of the language or cloud provider, I am working on large scale, distributed, and fault tolerant systems.

I like to build new projects, take apart established projects (usually breaking them in the process), and just explore different stuff I find interesting in software. Right now, I'm mostly writing C in my projects so that will be the current focus but the occassional post might be about/using C++ or Go.

I currently live in Indiana with my golden retriever, Jeffrey. I can be reached directly through the email address listed below or by opening an issue on this repository on github.
