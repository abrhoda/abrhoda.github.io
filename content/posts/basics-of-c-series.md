I wrote my first line of C in 2011 or 2012, in university while taking my first class on programming and since then, I've written countless lines of C. I've worked with C++, C#, go, java, python, and scala over the years but I always come back to writing C for my personal projects because it's what I find most interesting. I like writing programs and tools in a lower level language. However, the shift I shift out of "work mode" from go, java, or scala back to "project mode" writing C, basic concepts always seem jarring. Let's be real though: who hasn't searched "How do I declare an abstract class in python 3?" or something similar in your language of choice? Then, you question the stack overflow post from 2015 and it's relevance in the current year. Did that change in python 3.10 vs 3.14?

That's what this series is all about. Whenever I forget and start searching for a basic concept, I'll make a post about it titled with `Basics in C: XYZ` and tag it with the `basics` tag. Hopefully, this can serve as a place for myself and others to come and get a refresher on the basics of C in 2026. Posts will target ANSI C (C89) but I will call out when a feature of a later version of C has a different (and possibly better) solution.

If something stands out as incorrect and should be corrected for everyone's education, you can open an issue on this blog's github [repository](https://github.com/abrhoda/abrhoda.github.io) or email me at the email address found at the bottom of the page [here](https://abrhoda.github.io/about/).
