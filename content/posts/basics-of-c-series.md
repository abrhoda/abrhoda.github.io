I've written many enterprise type higher level languages over the years but I always come back to writing C for my personal projects. I like writing programs and tools in a lower level language. However, the return to C always has me searching basic syntax or concepts again. Let's be real though: who hasn't searched something like "How do I declare an abstract class in python 3?" or "Filter, map, and reduce with java streams" after over a decade of using the language? Then, you question the stack overflow post from 2015 and it's relevance in the current year. Did that change between language versions X and Y? Then you question everything about your career and existence.

That's what this series is all about. Whenever I forget and start searching for a basic concept, I'll make a post about it titled with `Basics in C: XYZ` and tag it with the `basics` tag. Hopefully, this can serve as a place for myself and others to come and get a refresher on the basics of C in 2026. Posts will target ANSI C (C89) but I will call out when a feature of a later version of C has a different (and possibly better) solution.

If something stands out as incorrect and should be corrected for everyone's education, you can open an issue on this blog's github [repository](https://github.com/abrhoda/abrhoda.github.io) or email me at the email address found at the bottom of the page [here](https://abrhoda.github.io/about/).
